**Where do built environment attributs most effectively influence bike sharing usage?**

This repository presents a comprehensive methodology for analyzing the nonlinear and spatially nonstationary effects of the built environment on bike-sharing usage. Using data from New York City, we apply a Geographically Weighted Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GW-GBDT) approach to capture local variations in feature importance.
